## üîß Configuration

After deployment, update your application's environment variables:

```env
# Update your .env file with the new database URL
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@your-host:5432/your-database"

# Optional: Configure other settings
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-jwt-secret"
ADMIN_JWT_SECRET="your-admin-jwt-secret"
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After deployment, verify everything works:

```bash
# Check table counts
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "
SELECT 
    'Categories' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM categories
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Subjects', COUNT(*) FROM subjects
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Exams', COUNT(*) FROM exams;"
```

Expected output:
- Categories: 2+
- Subjects: 15+
- Exams: 10+

## üîÑ Connecting Your Application

1. **Update your database connection** in `server/src/db.ts` if needed
2. **Restart your application** to connect to the new database
3. **Test the trending section** to ensure data is loading correctly
4. **Verify subject browsing** and exam functionality

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "SELECT version();"
```

### Missing Data
```bash
# Re-run the migration
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f migrations/supabase-export.sql
```

### Permission Issues
Ensure your database user has:
- CREATE permissions for schema creation
- INSERT permissions for data insertion
- SELECT permissions for application usage

## üìà Performance Notes

The migration includes optimized indexes for:
- Subject filtering by category/subcategory
- Exam lookups by subject
- Question queries by exam
- User interaction analytics

## üîê Security Considerations

- Use strong database credentials
- Restrict database access to your application servers
- Consider connection pooling for production deployments
- Regular backup your database after deployment

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your DATABASE_URL format is correct
3. Ensure the target database exists and is accessible
4. Confirm your database user has sufficient permissions

## üéØ Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. **Configure trending analytics** - Data will populate as users interact
2. **Add more subjects** - Use the admin panel to expand your catalog
3. **Import questions** - Use the CSV/JSON import features
4. **Set up monitoring** - Track performance and user engagement

Your remote database is now ready for production use with a comprehensive exam preparation platform!
