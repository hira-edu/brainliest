# Legacy Route Cleanup Plan

## Overview
After successful QA validation of the slug-based routing system, this document outlines the safe removal of legacy ID-based routes and navigation code.

## Pre-Cutover Checklist âœ…

### QA Validation Complete
- âœ… All API endpoints return slug data
- âœ… Slug-based lookups working correctly
- âœ… Database integrity validated (51 subjects, 19 exams with slugs)
- âœ… No duplicate slugs found
- âœ… Hierarchical routing endpoints functional
- âœ… Admin panel slug management operational

### Performance Verified
- âœ… Slug-based queries using proper indexes
- âœ… Response times comparable to ID-based queries
- âœ… No N+1 query issues identified

## Legacy Code Identification

### Frontend Components to Update
```typescript
// Files with legacy ID-based navigation
client/src/features/exam/pages/exam-selection.tsx
client/src/features/content/pages/subject-detail.tsx
client/src/features/shared/components/subject-card.tsx
```

### API Routes to Deprecate (Post-Cutover)
```typescript
// Keep for backward compatibility but mark as deprecated
GET /api/subjects/:id(\d+)     // Legacy subject lookup
GET /api/exams/:id(\d+)        // Legacy exam lookup

// Redirect to slug-based URLs
app.get('/subject/:id(\\d+)', redirectToSlug);
app.get('/exam/:id(\\d+)', redirectToSlug);
```

### Navigation Utilities to Remove
```typescript
// Remove ID-based navigation helpers
function navigateToSubjectById(id: number)
function getSubjectUrlById(id: number)
function getExamUrlById(id: number)
```

## Cutover Implementation Plan

### Phase 5A: Deprecation Warnings (Current)
1. Add deprecation warnings to legacy API endpoints
2. Log usage of ID-based routes for monitoring
3. Update documentation to recommend slug-based URLs

### Phase 5B: Redirect Implementation
```typescript
// Add redirects for legacy routes
app.get('/subject/:id(\\d+)', async (req, res) => {
  const subject = await storage.getSubject(parseInt(req.params.id));
  if (subject?.slug) {
    return res.redirect(301, `/subject/${subject.slug}`);
  }
  res.status(404).json({ message: 'Subject not found' });
});
```

### Phase 5C: Legacy Code Removal (Future)
1. Remove unused ID-based navigation utilities
2. Clean up redundant route handlers
3. Update internal links to use slug-based URLs only
4. Remove ID-based test cases

## Monitoring and Rollback

### Metrics to Track
- 404 error rates on slug-based URLs
- Legacy route usage (via deprecation logging)
- Page load performance comparison
- SEO ranking changes

### Rollback Procedure
1. Re-enable ID-based primary routes
2. Switch navigation utilities back to ID-based
3. Revert API responses to prioritize ID lookups
4. Investigate and fix slug-related issues

## Sitemap and SEO Updates

### Sitemap Generation Update
```typescript
// Update sitemap to use slug-based URLs
function generateSitemapXml() {
  const subjects = await storage.getSubjects();
  const urls = subjects.map(subject => ({
    loc: `${BASE_URL}/subject/${subject.slug}`,
    lastmod: new Date().toISOString(),
    changefreq: 'weekly',
    priority: '0.8'
  }));
  
  return generateXML(urls);
}
```

### Canonical URL Updates
```html
<!-- Update all pages to use slug-based canonical URLs -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://brainliest.com/subject/pmp-certification" />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://brainliest.com/subject/pmp-certification" />
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Slug generation is tested and working
- Database indexes are optimized
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Medium Risk
- External bookmarks to ID-based URLs
- Search engine indexed ID-based pages
- Third-party integrations using API

### Mitigation Strategies
- 301 redirects for all legacy routes
- Submit new sitemap to search engines
- Monitor error logs for broken links
- Gradual rollout with monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- Zero 500 errors related to slug routing
- 404 error rate < 1% for slug-based URLs
- Page load times within 10% of baseline
- All admin functions working correctly

### SEO Metrics
- No significant drop in search rankings
- Successful crawling of new slug-based URLs
- Social sharing links use new format
- Analytics tracking maintains continuity

## Timeline

### Immediate (Phase 5 Complete)
- âœ… QA validation complete
- âœ… Documentation updated
- âœ… Admin panel enhanced
- ðŸ”„ Legacy route deprecation warnings

### Week 1 (Post-Cutover)
