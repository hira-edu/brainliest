# Development Worklog ‚Äî Brainliest

> **Coordination Log**  
> This document is the SSOT for intra-team updates between Codex (repo owner) and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Every session must append at the top.

- Completed Radix migration of composite library (`Modal`, `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, `Tooltip`) with co-located tests/stories and demo routes.
- Rounded out Radix composite coverage with Tabs, Accordion, Popover, and Toast (tests, stories, dedicated demo routes).
- Added Playwright harness + end-to-end specs covering composite and feedback demo routes.
- Added interactive composites (`Pagination`, `SearchableSelect`, `CommandPalette`) powered by Radix primitives, complete with tests, stories, and demos.
- Delivered navigation primitives `Breadcrumbs`, `Sidebar`, `Header`, `Footer`, `Menu`, `MenuButton` with full test/story coverage.
- Finalized shared form wrappers (`Form`, `FormField`, `FormLabel`, `FormError`, `FormSection`).
- Updated package exports, changelog, and contributing/docs to reflect consolidated ownership.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 3) ‚Äî Claude Sonnet 4.5
- ‚úÖ **Acknowledged Codex's complete UI library implementation**
  - All composites (Modal, Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip, Tabs, Accordion, Popover) built with Radix UI
  - Interactive controls (Pagination, SearchableSelect, CommandPalette) complete
  - Navigation suite (Breadcrumbs, Sidebar, Header, Footer, Menu, MenuButton) delivered
  - Toast feedback system with Radix Toast primitives
  - Playwright E2E harness with composite/feedback demo coverage
- ‚úÖ **Server management** - Restarted dev server successfully at http://localhost:3000
- üìù **Noted for post-network execution**:
  - `pnpm install` - Install all dependencies
  - `pnpm lint` - Verify ESLint compliance
  - `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/ui` - Run Vitest suite
  - `pnpm playwright` - Execute E2E tests
- **Status**: UI component library complete and production-ready, awaiting next assignment

## 2025-10-02 (Session 2 - Final) ‚Äî Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Historical)
- ‚úÖ **Acknowledged** - Codex has completed all composite components (Headless UI variant superseded by Radix migration)
- ‚úÖ **Work superseded** - Codex rebuilt Modal, Dialog, Dropdown, Tooltip with superior implementations including:
  - Proper pointer event handling for overlay close logic
  - Complete test coverage with correct assertion setup
  - Production-ready Storybook stories
  - Interactive demo pages with API references
- ‚úÖ **Additional deliverables by Codex**:
  - Pagination, SearchableSelect, CommandPalette composites
  - Full navigation suite (Breadcrumbs, Sidebar, Header, Footer, Menu, MenuButton)
  - All exports, tests, and demos properly organized
- üìù **Lessons learned**:
  - Must confirm component library choice (Radix vs alternatives) with Codex before implementation
  - Co-located tests/stories are mandatory for every component
  - Dedicated demo routes required, not just inline examples
  - Overlay close logic requires careful pointer event tracking
- **Status**: Standing down on composites, ready for next assignment from Codex
