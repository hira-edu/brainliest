# Development Worklog — Brainliest

> **Coordination Log**  
> This document is the SSOT for intra-team updates between Codex (repo owner) and Claude Sonnet 4.5. Every session must append at the top.

## 2025-10-03 (Session 13) — Codex
- ♻️ **Practice header alignment** — Moved the timer pill, bookmark, flag, and AI explanation controls into `PracticeQuestionActions` so the question card header remains the single surface for quick actions.
- 🧭 **Navigation trim** — Simplified `PracticeNavigation`/`PracticeQuestionFooter` to handle pagination only, preventing duplicate bookmark/flag/timer UI in the footer and keeping the layout modular.
- 🧪 **Validation** — `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/ui`, `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/web`, `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/ui`.
- ✨ **Dual explanation SSOT** — Introduced `PracticeExplainButton` so both question-level and answer-level AI triggers share identical styling, relocated the question toggle beneath the prompt, and wired footer controls (AI button, navigation, submit/reveal) through the shared practice footer layout.

- Wired practice navigation to the session API with a client container that manages question advance, flag state, and answer persistence across questions.
- Persisted AI explanation generations through the Drizzle repository and surfaced an admin log/API for auditing.
- Added pagination to `/api/explanations` and updated the admin activity view to read from the shared endpoint instead of direct repository access.
- Stood up practice session storage (Drizzle repositories + `/api/practice/sessions` routes) and rewired the practice page/actions to call the new API while keeping the sample fallback for offline use.
- Added Vitest API coverage for `/api/explanations`, validating pagination defaults and legacy query handling.
- Completed Radix migration of composite library (`Modal`, `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, `Tooltip`) with co-located tests/stories and demo routes.
- Rounded out Radix composite coverage with Tabs, Accordion, Popover, and Toast (tests, stories, dedicated demo routes).
- Added Playwright harness + end-to-end specs covering composite and feedback demo routes.
- Added interactive composites (`Pagination`, `SearchableSelect`, `CommandPalette`) powered by Radix primitives, complete with tests, stories, and demos.
- Delivered navigation primitives `Breadcrumbs`, `Sidebar`, `Header`, `Footer`, `Menu`, `MenuButton` with full test/story coverage.
- Finalized shared form wrappers (`Form`, `FormField`, `FormLabel`, `FormError`, `FormSection`).
- Updated package exports, changelog, and contributing/docs to reflect consolidated ownership.
- Introduced an automated cleanup script with package alias to remove demo routes and test/story artifacts on demand.
- Bootstrapped `@brainliest/config` (env schemas, redis keys, routes, feature flags) and `@brainliest/shared` (domain models, analytics contracts) to anchor upcoming platform workstreams.
- Integrated shared AI explanation + cache services into the web/admin apps with Next.js API routes, rate limiting, and Redis-backed invalidation stubs.
- Established `@brainliest/db` with Drizzle schema, repository interfaces, and database client tooling to anchor upcoming data access workstreams.

## 2025-10-03 (Session 12) — Codex
- 📊 **Admin dashboard wiring** — Replaced the static landing page with live metrics sourced from `/api/explanations`, including aggregate KPIs, a latest-generation table, and subject leaderboard links back to the activity log.
- 🔁 **Shared fetch helper** — Added `apps/admin/src/lib/explanations.ts` so both the dashboard and activity log reuse a typed helper that resolves the admin base URL, validates payloads, and normalises timestamps.
- 📈 **Metrics endpoint** — Introduced `/api/explanations/metrics` powered by new repository aggregates so the dashboard can report lifetime totals, spend, and averages alongside the recent activity table.
- 🧹 **Practice lint pass** — Removed redundant type assertions across the practice data pipeline, added a guard when deriving the active question, and re-ran `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/web` to confirm the route is clean.
- 🧪 **Playwright coverage** — Expanded `tests/playwright/specs/practice.spec.ts` to exercise flagging, bookmarking, timer countdown, and persistence across reloads using the API intercept harness.
- 🧭 **Practice UX polish** — Moved the navigation controls beneath the submit CTA, introduced header icon buttons (bookmark/flag plus AI explanation), and added question-level explanation reveal using stored markdown so the layout mirrors the UI spec.
- ✅ **Validation** — `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/admin`, `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/web`.

## 2025-10-03 (Session 11) — Codex
- 🧭 **Practice navigation sync** — Introduced `PracticeSessionContainer` to orchestrate session state on the client, enabling next/previous navigation, shared flag toggles, and answer persistence backed by the new `/api/practice/sessions` PATCH operations (with a sample fallback for offline use).
- 🔖 **Bookmark persistence** — Added `toggle-bookmark` handling end-to-end (API + repository + container) so saved questions survive reloads and stay in lockstep with the navigation controls.
- ⏱️ **Timer heartbeat** — Added a countdown loop that tracks remaining seconds locally and persists them to the session API every 30 seconds (and on expiry) so the timer label stays accurate across devices.
- 📦 **Shared practice data** — Extended `PracticeSessionData` and mappers so API responses expose the full question list, flagged/bookmarked IDs, and session status—allowing clients to react to repository updates without extra queries.
- 🧑‍💻 **Client refactor** — Updated `PracticeClient`, navigation panel, and fetch helpers to consume the new container callbacks while keeping optimistic updates and lint coverage intact.
- 🧪 **Playwright stubs** — Added request interception in the composite/practice specs so AI explanation and session APIs return deterministic fixtures, keeping the E2E suite stable without hitting live services.
- ✅ **Validation** — `pnpm exec eslint apps/web/src/app/practice/[examSlug] --max-warnings=0`, `pnpm exec eslint tests/playwright/specs/{composites,practice}.spec.ts --max-warnings=0`, `pnpm --filter @brainliest/web typecheck`, `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`.

## 2025-10-03 (Session 10) — Codex
*(see prior entry for Drizzle persistence and admin reporting work)*
- 🧠 **Practice session API** — Added session repository contracts, Drizzle implementation, and Vitest coverage so timers/flags/progress persist in Postgres.
- 🌐 **Next.js routes** — Exposed `/api/practice/sessions` (POST) and `/api/practice/sessions/[sessionId]` (GET/PATCH) to serve session DTOs and accept progress mutations.
- 🧑‍💻 **Client wiring** — Refactored `fetchPracticeSession` + `PracticeClient` to consume the new endpoints, record answer selection, and toggle flags while preserving the sample fallback.
- 🧾 **Documentation** — Updated changelog/worklog with the new practice runtime and queued follow-up coordination.
- ✅ **Validation** — `pnpm --filter @brainliest/db typecheck`, `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`.
- ⚠️ **Note** — Skipped `@brainliest/web` typecheck (pre-existing workspace issues unrelated to this change).

## 2025-10-03 (Session 9) — Codex
- 🔄 **Drizzle persistence** — Replaced the AI explanation stub hook with the shared Drizzle repository so web flows read/write from Postgres.
- 🗃️ **Repository upgrades** — Added `listRecent` reporting helper, pagination metadata, and refreshed exports/tests so downstream services can page through history.
- 📈 **Admin reporting** — Built `/api/explanations`, migrated the AI Explanation Activity page to consume it, and linked the view from the home screen for quick access.
- 📝 **Docs & coordination** — Updated changelog and worklog to capture the persistence sync and outline follow-up owners.
- ✅ **Validation** — `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/db`, `pnpm --filter @brainliest/db typecheck`, `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`.
- 🔜 **Next up** — Migrate remaining consumer dashboards/views off stub data to the new `/api/explanations` endpoint and flesh out pagination/filtering on the repository.
  - ✅ Confirmed no other reporting surfaces exist yet; dashboards remain stubbed until upcoming workstreams wire them to the new endpoint.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 8) — Codex
- 🗄️ **Database foundation** — Scaffolded `@brainliest/db` with Drizzle schema spanning taxonomy, assessment, user, and admin tables plus supporting enums.
- 📚 **Repository contracts** — Added question/exam/user/explanation repository interfaces and exported shared pagination types.
- 🔧 **Infrastructure tooling** — Added Drizzle client wrapper, migration scripts, and workspace wiring (package.json, drizzle config, lockfile).
- 🧪 **Schema verification** — Introduced Vitest coverage for enums/defaults and wired ESLint/TypeScript configs for the new database package.
- ⚡ **AI demo integration** — Replaced the UI fixture with a Drizzle-backed question lookup (fallbacks in dev) and wired Searchable Select + Command Palette demos to `/api/ai/explanations`.
- 🧩 **Practice wiring** — Added `apps/web/src/app/practice/[examSlug]/actions.ts` to share the server-side AI service configuration so upcoming practice flows reuse the same infrastructure.
- ✅ **Playwright coverage** — Extended composite specs to assert the new explanation output in both Searchable Select and Command Palette demos, and added a `/practice/[examSlug]` smoke test verifying the AI explanation stub.
- 🧱 **Practice UI kit** — Introduced reusable modules (`PracticeLayout`, `PracticeExamCard`, `PracticeQuestionCard`, `PracticeOptionList`, `PracticeExplanationCard`, `PracticeNavigation`, `PracticePageHeader`) to standardize the practice experience across apps.
- 🧭 **Practice page scaffold** — Implemented `/practice/[examSlug]/page.tsx` with the new modules, wiring the client experience to `requestExplanationAction` and responsive sidebar meta cards.
- 🎯 **Session stubs** — Added toggle-ready navigation controls (flag/bookmark) and a client sidebar panel so backend mutations can plug in without reshaping the UI.
- 🔭 **Next up** — Connect the practice layout to real session data (timer, flagging, progress) and extend Playwright to cover the practice route once the backend is ready.

- 🔜 **Next up** — Generate initial migrations & seeds, implement Drizzle repository classes, and wire database services into apps.
## 2025-10-02 (Session 7) — Codex
- 🔌 **AI service wiring** — Added shared configuration helpers, zod schemas, and a rate-limited orchestrator that wraps the OpenAI explanation adapter.
- 🌐 **Web API integration** — Bootstrapped `/api/ai/explanations` with shared fixtures, schema validation, and structured error responses for rate limits and question lookup.
- 🛡️ **Admin cache hooks** — Exposed `/api/cache/invalidate` to fan out to shared cache invalidation helpers for exams and categories.
- 🧪 **Validation** — Added schema unit tests alongside the new shared surface to keep coverage intact.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 6) — Codex
- 🧭 **Config scaffolding** — Created `packages/config` with server/client env parsers, redis key registry, feature flags, and route helpers; added unit coverage for env parsing.
- 🧩 **Shared domain layer** — Added `packages/shared` with branded domain models plus analytics registry/tracker contracts, including tests for the new tracking pipeline.
- 🛠️ **Workspace wiring** — Updated TypeScript path aliases, package manifests, and lint/test hooks so downstream apps can consume the new config/shared exports immediately.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 5) — Codex
- ✅ **Radix Select upgrade** — Replaced the primitive `<select>` with a Radix Select wrapper that supports keyboard navigation, custom sizing/state treatment, and hidden form inputs.
- ✅ **Toast variants** — Introduced semantic variants (default/success/warning/error/info), styled action + close affordances, and refreshed stories/tests.
- ✅ **Tooltip provider guidance** — Exported `TooltipProvider` so consumers share a single provider; updated tests, stories, and demos to wrap tooltips appropriately.
- 📝 **Docs & changelog** — Documented the above changes and confirmed the UI docs now reflect the Radix-first approach throughout.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 4) — Codex
- ✅ **Built cleanup tooling** — Added `scripts/cleanup-tests-demos.js` (dry-run by default, `--apply` to delete) to purge demo directories and test/story files for production builds.
- 🔧 **Repository wiring** — Registered `pnpm cleanup:tests-demos` and updated `docs/dev/contributing.md` with usage guidance.
- 📝 **Next steps** — Run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/ui`, and `pnpm playwright` when automation is available to validate the Radix migration end-to-end.
- ♻️ **Refined SearchableSelect** — Rebuilt composite with Radix Popover + `cmdk`, refreshed stories/tests, and removed legacy documentation pointing to the prior implementation.
- 🎛️ **Stabilized CommandPalette** — Adopted `cmdk` grouping best practices, added consistent sizing, and ensured keyboard navigation no longer triggers layout shifts.

## 2025-10-02 (Session 3) — Claude Sonnet 4.5
