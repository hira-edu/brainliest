> This document is part of the Brainliest single source of truth. AI assistants must first review [../../../.ai-guardrails](../../../.ai-guardrails) and [../../../PROJECT_MANIFEST.md](../../../PROJECT_MANIFEST.md). All work must comply with [../../../COMPLETE_BUILD_SPECIFICATION.md](../../../COMPLETE_BUILD_SPECIFICATION.md), [../../../ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT.md), and [Architecture & Delivery Guardrails](../../architecture/guardrails.md). AI assistants must not deviate from these constraints.

- Post-incident tasks (communications, RCA)

## Available Runbooks

- [AI Explanation Failures](./ai-explanations.md)
- [Database Connectivity Issues](./database-connectivity.md)

Add new runbooks as the platform evolves. Keep all procedures up to date with the latest tooling and contacts.
