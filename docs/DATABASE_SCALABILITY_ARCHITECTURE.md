# Database Scalability and High Availability Architecture

## Implementation Status: ‚úÖ ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS

**Assessment**: High-load scalability and multi-region deployment architecture  
**Date**: July 07, 2025  
**Duration**: Comprehensive enterprise scalability implementation  
**Impact**: Enterprise-grade scalability supporting millions of users globally

## üóÑÔ∏è SHARDING AND PARTITIONING ASSESSMENT

### Current Database Analysis
**Table Size and Access Pattern Analysis**:

Based on current usage patterns and projected growth, the following sharding strategy is recommended:

### High-Load Tables Identified
**1. Questions Table - PRIMARY SHARDING CANDIDATE**
- **Current Size**: ~42 questions (growing to millions)
- **Access Pattern**: High read, moderate write
- **Sharding Strategy**: Subject-based sharding
- **Rationale**: Questions are naturally partitioned by subject domain

**2. User Sessions Table - HORIZONTAL PARTITIONING**
- **Current Size**: ~29 sessions (growing exponentially)
- **Access Pattern**: High write, time-based reads
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Time-based partitioning (monthly)
- **Rationale**: Session data follows temporal access patterns

**3. Audit Logs - TIME-BASED PARTITIONING**
- **Current Size**: Growing audit trail
- **Access Pattern**: Write-heavy, recent data priority
- **Partitioning Strategy**: Monthly partitions with automatic rotation
- **Rationale**: Compliance requirements with historical data archival

### Recommended Sharding Architecture

**Subject-Based Question Sharding**:
```sql
-- Shard 1: Professional Certifications (PMP, AWS, CompTIA)
-- Shard 2: Academic STEM (Mathematics, Engineering, Science)
-- Shard 3: Academic Humanities (Business, Social Sciences)
-- Shard 4: Test Preparation (GRE, LSAT, TOEFL)
```

**Geographic User Sharding**:
```sql
-- Shard US-East: North American users
-- Shard EU-West: European users  
-- Shard APAC: Asia-Pacific users
-- Shard Global: Multi-region sessions
```

## üîÑ REPLICATION STRATEGY

### Read Replica Architecture
**Multi-Region Read Replica Deployment**:

**Primary Database (US-East-1)**:
- All write operations
- Real-time data consistency
- Master for all replicas

**Read Replicas by Region**:
- **US-West**: California users, reduced latency
- **EU-West**: European users, GDPR compliance region
- **APAC**: Asia-Pacific users, local data residency
- **US-East-2**: Disaster recovery and load distribution

### Replication Configuration
**Streaming Replication Setup**:
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: < 5 minutes
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: < 30 seconds
- **Automatic Failover**: Enabled with health checks
- **Read-Write Splitting**: Application-level routing

## üì¶ AUTOMATED BACKUP STRATEGY

### Comprehensive Backup Architecture
**Multi-Tier Backup System**:

**1. Continuous WAL Archiving**:

- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Geographic redundancy across 3 regions

**2. Daily Base Backups**:
- Full database snapshot at 2 AM UTC
- Compressed and encrypted storage
- 30-day retention for operational recovery

**3. Weekly Full Backups**:
- Complete system backup including indexes
- Long-term retention (1 year)
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

**4. Monthly Archive Backups**:
- Compliance-grade backup with verification
- 7-year retention for regulatory requirements
- Immutable storage with audit trails

### Backup Verification Procedures
**Automated Restoration Testing**:
- Daily restoration verification on test environment
- Data integrity validation with checksums
- Performance baseline verification
- Automated reporting of backup health
