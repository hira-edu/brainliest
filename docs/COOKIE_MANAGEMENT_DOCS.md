# Cookie Management System Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive, enterprise-grade cookie management system implemented across the Brainliest platform. The system ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance, provides transparent user controls, and maintains security best practices.

## System Architecture

### Client-Side Components

#### 1. Cookie Utilities (`client/src/lib/cookie-utils.ts`)
- **CookieManager Class**: Comprehensive client-side cookie operations
- **Cookie Registry**: Centralized definition of all platform cookies
- **React Hooks**: Easy integration with React components
- **Type-Safe Operations**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces

#### 2. Cookie Consent Banner (`client/src/components/cookie-consent-banner.tsx`)
- **GDPR Compliant**: Meets European data protection requirements
- **User Choice**: Accept All, Customize, or Reject options
- **Category Management**: Granular control over cookie categories
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper ARIA labels

#### 3. Cookie Settings Page (`client/src/pages/cookie-settings.tsx`)
- **Full Management Interface**: Complete cookie preference management
- **Live Status Display**: Shows active cookies and their purposes
- **Data Export**: Users can download their cookie data
- **Consent Revocation**: Clear process to withdraw consent

### Server-Side Components

#### 1. Cookie Service (`server/cookie-service.ts`)
- **Secure Defaults**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite attributes
- **Authentication Tokens**: Specialized handling for auth cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: Token-based CSRF prevention
- **Consent Validation**: Server-side cookie category checking

## Cookie Categories

### Essential Cookies (Always Active)
- `session_token`: User authentication and session management (24 hours)
- `auth_refresh`: Secure session refresh token (7 days)
- `cookies_accepted`: Track cookie consent status (1 year)
- `cookie_preferences`: Store detailed cookie preferences (1 year)

### Functional Cookies (Optional)
- `user_preferences`: Store user interface preferences (1 year)

### Analytics Cookies (Optional)
- `analytics_enabled`: Enable usage analytics (1 year)
- `performance_tracking`: Performance monitoring (30 days)

### Marketing Cookies (Optional)
- Currently defined in registry for future implementation

## Security Features

### Client-Side Security
- **XSS Protection**: All cookie values are properly encoded/decoded
- **Secure Attributes**: Automatic HTTPS detection for secure flag
- **SameSite Protection**: Prevents CSRF attacks
- **Cookie Validation**: Malformed cookie handling

### Server-Side Security
- **HttpOnly Enforcement**: Authentication cookies not accessible via JavaScript
- **CSRF Tokens**: Unique tokens for state-changing operations
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security header implementation
- **Audit Logging**: Cookie operations logged for security monitoring

## Compliance Features

### GDPR Compliance
- **Explicit Consent**: Clear opt-in for non-essential cookies
- **Granular Control**: Category-based cookie management
- **Right to Withdraw**: Easy consent revocation process
- **Data Portability**: Cookie data export functionality
- **Transparency**: Clear descriptions of each cookie's purpose

### Documentation Requirements
- **Purpose Limitation**: Each cookie has defined, specific purpose
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary cookies are used
- **Storage Limitation**: Appropriate expiration times set
- **User Rights**: Full access to preferences and data

## User Experience

### First Visit Flow
1. User arrives on platform
2. Cookie consent banner appears at bottom
3. User can Accept All, Customize, or Reject
4. Preferences are stored and applied immediately

### Ongoing Management
1. User can access Cookie Settings from footer or privacy menu
2. Real-time view of active cookies and their status
3. Toggle categories on/off as needed
4. Export personal cookie data anytime
5. Revoke consent and clear all non-essential cookies

## API Integration

### Cookie Consent Endpoints
```typescript
// Check if user has consented to specific category
GET /api/cookies/consent/:category

// Update user cookie preferences
POST /api/cookies/preferences
```

### Middleware Integration
```typescript
// Require specific cookie category for endpoint
app.use('/api/analytics', requireCookieConsent('analytics'));
```

## Implementation Details

### Cookie Banner Integration
The banner automatically appears for new visitors and integrates seamlessly with the platform's design system. It's non-blocking but persistent until user action is taken.

### Preference Persistence
User preferences are stored in both client-side cookies and can be synchronized with user accounts for logged-in users.

### Cross-Device Consistency
For authenticated users, cookie preferences can be synchronized across devices through the backend storage system.

## Testing

### Functional Tests
- Cookie setting/getting operations
