# Slug-Based Routing QA Checklist

## Phase 5 Comprehensive Testing

### Navigation Path Testing

#### ‚úÖ Public Frontend Routes
- [ ] Homepage subject cards use slug URLs
- [ ] All Subjects page uses slug navigation
- [ ] Category pages use slug-based subject links
- [ ] Subject detail pages load correctly via slug
- [ ] Exam detail pages load correctly via slug
- [ ] Question interface navigation works with slugs
- [ ] Back navigation maintains slug consistency

#### ‚úÖ API Endpoint Testing
- [ ] `/api/subjects/slug/:slug` returns correct subject data
- [ ] `/api/exams/slug/:slug` returns correct exam data
- [ ] Hierarchical routes: `/api/subjects/slug/:subjectSlug/exams`
- [ ] Hierarchical routes: `/api/subjects/slug/:subjectSlug/exams/slug/:examSlug`
- [ ] Hierarchical routes: `/api/subjects/slug/:subjectSlug/exams/slug/:examSlug/questions`

#### ‚úÖ Admin Panel Testing
- [ ] Subject CRUD operations with slug management
- [ ] Exam CRUD operations with slug management
- [ ] Question CRUD operations with hierarchical relationships
- [ ] Slug uniqueness validation
- [ ] Slug override functionality
- [ ] Hierarchical selector component displays correct relationships

### Resource Relationship Testing

#### ‚úÖ CRUD Operations
- [ ] Create subject auto-generates slug
- [ ] Update subject maintains/updates slug
- [ ] Create exam auto-generates slug
- [ ] Update exam maintains/updates slug
- [ ] Delete operations maintain referential integrity
- [ ] Bulk operations preserve slug relationships

#### ‚úÖ Data Integrity
- [ ] All existing subjects have valid slugs
- [ ] All existing exams have valid slugs
- [ ] No duplicate slugs in database
- [ ] Slug generation handles special characters
- [ ] Slug validation prevents conflicts

### SEO and Link Sharing Testing

#### ‚úÖ URL Structure
- [ ] All public URLs use slugs: `/subject/pmp-certification`
- [ ] Hierarchical URLs: `/subjects/pmp-certification/exams/practice-exam-1`
- [ ] Canonical URLs in meta tags use slugs
- [ ] Social sharing URLs use slugs
- [ ] Sitemap.xml generation includes slug-based URLs

#### ‚úÖ Backward Compatibility
- [ ] Legacy ID-based URLs redirect to slug URLs
- [ ] Old bookmarks continue to work
- [ ] External links to ID-based URLs resolve correctly
- [ ] Search engine indexed ID URLs redirect properly

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### ‚úÖ Error Scenarios
- [ ] Invalid slug returns 404 with proper error page
- [ ] Non-existent subject slug handled gracefully
- [ ] Non-existent exam slug handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed slug patterns rejected
- [ ] Database connection errors handled properly

#### ‚úÖ Edge Cases
- [ ] Slugs with special characters work correctly
- [ ] Very long subject/exam names generate valid slugs
- [ ] Duplicate name handling creates unique slugs
- [ ] Unicode characters in names handled properly
- [ ] Empty or null slug scenarios handled

### Performance Testing

#### ‚úÖ Database Performance
- [ ] Slug-based queries use proper indexes
- [ ] Query performance comparable to ID-based queries
- [ ] No N+1 query problems in hierarchical routes
- [ ] Database constraints prevent duplicate slugs

#### ‚úÖ Frontend Performance
- [ ] Slug-based navigation as fast as ID-based
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders during navigation
- [ ] Proper caching of slug-based API responses
- [ ] Mobile performance maintained

### Admin Experience Testing

#### ‚úÖ Admin Panel Functionality
- [ ] Slug management components render correctly
- [ ] Slug editing and validation works
- [ ] Hierarchical selector shows correct relationships
- [ ] Resource creation with slug override works
- [ ] Bulk import/export maintains slug integrity
- [ ] CSV operations handle slugs correctly

### Documentation and Help

#### ‚úÖ User-Facing Documentation
- [ ] Updated API documentation includes slug endpoints
- [ ] Admin help explains slug management
- [ ] Migration guide documents slug transition
- [ ] SEO best practices documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for slug issues

### Final Cutover Preparation

#### ‚úÖ Legacy Code Cleanup
- [ ] Identified all ID-based navigation code
- [ ] Marked legacy routes for removal
- [ ] Updated all internal links to use slugs
- [ ] Prepared redirect rules for ID-based URLs
- [ ] Tested sitemap regeneration with slug URLs

## Test Results Summary
