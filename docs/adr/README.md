# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Maintain a chronological log of significant architectural decisions. Each ADR should capture:

- Context
- Decision
- Alternatives considered
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Date and status

## Workflow

1. Copy the template (`template.md`) to a new file named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
2. Fill out sections with as much detail as needed.
3. Discuss in pull request or architecture review meeting.
4. Update status (`Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Superseded` as appropriate).

## Index

| ADR | Status | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _None yet_ | | |

Keep this index updated whenever new ADRs are added or superseded.
