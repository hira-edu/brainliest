## 📝 Creating Additional Admin Users

I've created multiple tools for you to create additional admin users:

node scripts/create-admin-user.js
```

### Option 2: Bash Script with cURL
```bash
./scripts/create-admin-curl.sh
```

# Login first
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@brainliest.com","password":"Super.Admin.123!@#"}'

# Then create user with the token
curl -X POST "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/admin/users" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"email":"new-admin@yourdomain.com","password":"SecurePassword123!","role":"admin"}'
```
