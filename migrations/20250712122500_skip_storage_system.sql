-- Migration to handle Supabase storage system conflicts
-- This migration skips storage system tables that require superuser permissions

-- Skip storage.prefixes triggers that cause permission errors
-- The storage.prefixes table is managed by Supabase and should not be modified in local development

-- Instead, we'll ensure our application tables are properly set up
-- This migration serves as a placeholder to maintain migration numbering

-- Add any custom storage policies if needed (but avoid storage.prefixes)
-- Storage system is handled by Supabase automatically in production

-- Placeholder comment to maintain valid SQL file
