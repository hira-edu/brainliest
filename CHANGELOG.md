## [2.2.9] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- **Practice session lifecycle** — Extended the session metadata schema to track submitted and revealed question IDs plus stored correctness, and introduced Drizzle repository helpers (`submitAnswer`, `revealAnswer`) exposed through the existing `/api/practice/sessions/[sessionId]` PATCH handler.

### Changed
- **Practice UI wiring** — Updated `PracticeSessionContainer`/`PracticeClient` to call the new submit/reveal mutations, surface submission state in the header status messaging, and keep the sample fallback in sync with server behaviour.
- **End-to-end coverage** — Expanded the practice Playwright intercepts to emulate submit/reveal flows and added assertions for disabled/enabled footer CTAs and persisted reveal state after reloads.
- **Build stability** — Replaced the Google-hosted Inter font with the Tailwind sans stack so builds succeed in offline or sandboxed environments.
- **Practice status alerts** — Replaced inline status copy with the shared `Alert` component so correct/incorrect answers, AI explanation states, and demos surface contextual success/warning/error banners from a single module.
- **Course navigation shell** — Added `PracticeCourseNavigation`, composing `Sidebar` and `Menu` for course-level navigation and surfaced the new module in the practice navigation demo so flags/bookmarks/analytics stay SSOT.
- **Practice breadcrumbs** — Extended `PracticePageHeader` with breadcrumb/back-link support and wired the practice route to display category → subcategory → exam identifiers sourced from the session payload.
- **Catalog showcase** — Introduced modular catalog pages (`/catalog`, `/catalog/[category]`, `/catalog/[category]/[subcategory]`) backed by the new taxonomy repository so shared layout/navigation/exam cards present live categories, tracks, and certification exams.

### Tests
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`
- `pnpm --filter @brainliest/web typecheck`
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/web`

  - Generated secure cryptographic keys (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `SITE_KMS_MASTER_KEY`) using OpenSSL
  - Created symlinks from app directories to root `.env` file for proper environment variable loading
  - Configured DATABASE_URL for Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling support

- **Database Infrastructure**
  - Successfully executed initial database migration (`202510020900_init.sql`)
  - Created 19 database tables covering taxonomy, questions, users, admin, and platform controls
  - Created all PostgreSQL enums (12 types) and database indexes
  - Enabled pgcrypto extension for UUID generation and encryption

### Changed
- **Practice session UI**
  - Consolidated timer, bookmark, and flag controls inside `PracticeQuestionActions` so the question header remains the single source of truth for quick actions.
  - Trimmed `PracticeNavigation`/`PracticeQuestionFooter` to pagination-only responsibilities, eliminating duplicate flag/bookmark/timer surfaces in the footer and keeping modules reusable.
  - Added shared `PracticeExplainButton`, moved the question-level toggle beneath the prompt, and routed the footer through a single layout housing the answer-level AI button, navigation, and submit/reveal CTAs.
  - Refined the footer layout so the AI toggle and submit button align on the right, submission auto-reveals answer outcomes, and progress sits between previous/next controls without extra copy.
  - Introduced a “Finish exam” control that appears on the final question, completes the session, and redirects to the new `/practice/[examSlug]/summary` results view.
  - Updated Playwright coverage to validate the new summary redirect and finish-button lifecycle across single- and multi-question sessions.
- **Environment Variable Management**
  - Updated seed script execution to use explicit DATABASE_URL environment variable
  - Fixed environment variable loading for tsx-based scripts
  - Standardized .env file structure with comprehensive comments and sections

### Fixed
- **Database Connection Issues**
  - Resolved ZodError for missing DATABASE_URL in Next.js application

## [2.2.7] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Admin dashboard now surfaces live AI explanation KPIs, latest generations, and a subject leaderboard powered by the `/api/explanations` endpoint.
 - Practice navigation demo page (`/demo/practice/navigation`) for quickly exercising the shared layout without hitting the API.

### Changed
- Extracted a shared explanation fetch helper (`apps/admin/src/lib/explanations.ts`) so the dashboard and activity log reuse payload validation, base URL detection, and timestamp normalisation.
- Added `/api/explanations/metrics` plus repository aggregates to deliver lifetime totals/averages for the admin dashboard KPIs.
- Extended `tests/playwright/specs/practice.spec.ts` to cover bookmarking, flagging, and timer countdown across reloads so the session API wiring stays regression-proof.
- Tightened the practice session fallback/mappers by removing redundant type assertions and guarding active-question selection to keep the pipeline lint-clean while backend wiring stabilises.
- Reworked the practice question card layout with header icon actions (bookmark/flag + AI explanation), relocated navigation under the submit CTA, and added a question-level explanation reveal sourced from stored markdown.

### Tests
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/admin`
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/web`
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/db`
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`

## [2.2.6] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- `PracticeSessionContainer` client coordinator that keeps session state in sync with `/api/practice/sessions`, powering next/previous navigation, shared flag/bookmark toggles, and local fallbacks when the API is offline.
- Session bookmark toggling exposed via the practice API (`toggle-bookmark`) and persisted through Drizzle metadata so navigation buttons and question cards stay consistent across reloads.

### Changed
- Extended `PracticeSessionData` and mapping utilities to expose the full question list, flagged/bookmarked question IDs, and session metadata so clients can react to repository updates without additional queries.
- Refactored the practice page, navigation panel, and `PracticeClient` to use the new container callbacks—removing duplicate fetch logic and ensuring optimistic updates stay consistent across questions.
- Updated the practice fallback builder to emit container-compatible questions so sample sessions behave like persisted ones, including bookmark state.
- Added a lightweight timer heartbeat that syncs remaining seconds back to the session API every 30 seconds to keep multi-device views aligned.
- Stabilised Playwright demos by intercepting `/api/ai/explanations` and practice session routes with deterministic fixtures so the suite no longer relies on live persistence.

### Tests
- `pnpm exec eslint apps/web/src/app/practice/[examSlug] --max-warnings=0`

## [2.2.5] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Admin API route `/api/explanations` and the accompanying log page in `apps/admin` so operators can review recently generated AI explanations backed by Drizzle.
- Practice session infrastructure surfaced through `@brainliest/db` repositories plus Next.js routes (`/api/practice/sessions`, `/api/practice/sessions/[sessionId]`) to deliver timers, flags, and progress mutations.

### Changed
- Replaced the AI explanation stub pipeline with the Drizzle repository, propagating language/version metadata through the shared adapters, web bootstrap, and server helper.
- Extended the explanation repository contract with a `listRecent` helper for reporting, refreshed exports, and updated unit tests to cover the new shape.
- Added pagination metadata to `/api/explanations`, updating the admin activity view to consume the endpoint and paginate results from the shared repository.
- Backfilled Vitest coverage for `/api/explanations`, exercising paginated responses plus query parameter edge cases.
- Refactored the practice experience to consume the new session endpoints, wiring client actions to persist answer selection and flag toggles while retaining the sample fallback for offline development.

### Tests
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/db`
- `pnpm --filter @brainliest/db typecheck`
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`

## [2.2.4] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Introduced `@brainliest/db` workspace package with Drizzle ORM schema covering taxonomy, assessment, user, and admin tables with enums and relations.
- Added Drizzle CLI configuration, migration scaffolding, and Vitest coverage to validate enum/default mappings.
- Exported repository interfaces and pagination helpers so services can adopt the new database layer immediately.
- Hooked the AI explanation API into demo flows by sourcing questions from the Drizzle repository and wiring the Searchable Select/Command Palette demos to `/api/ai/explanations`.
- Added practice server action scaffolding that reuses the shared AI service configuration for upcoming session flows.
- Extended Playwright composite specs to assert the explanation summaries produced by the new demos.
- Created a reusable practice UI kit (`PracticeLayout`, `PracticeExamCard`, `PracticeQuestionCard`, `PracticeOptionList`, `PracticeFillBlank`, `PracticeExplanationCard`, `PracticeNavigation`, `PracticePageHeader`) and adopted it in the new `/practice/[examSlug]` scaffold.
- Practice page now resolves exam/question data through Drizzle repositories with graceful fallbacks so the session shell runs ahead of full backend integration.
- Practice navigation exposes flag/bookmark controls with client-side stubs so future backend mutations can reuse the same UI surface.

## [2.2.3] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Shared AI explanation orchestration (`packages/shared/src/services/ai-explanation.ts`) with configurable rate limiting, question lookup, and analytics tracking hooks.
- Zod schemas for AI explanation requests/responses published via `@brainliest/shared` for consistent validation across apps.
- Next.js API route `/api/ai/explanations` in the web app, backed by the shared service with fixture-driven question lookup for local development.
- Admin API route `/api/cache/invalidate` bridging to shared cache invalidation helpers for exams and categories.

### Changed
- Bootstrapped web-side AI configuration helper to ensure Radix-driven composites can call the shared service without duplicating setup logic.
- Added schema unit tests to keep `@brainliest/shared` coverage aligned with new exports.

## [2.2.2] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Cleanup utility `scripts/cleanup-tests-demos.js` with dry-run safety to remove demo routes and test/story files for production-only deployments.
- Workspace script alias `pnpm cleanup:tests-demos` documented in contributing guide.
- Bootstrapped `@brainliest/config` (env schemas, redis keys, feature flags, routes) and `@brainliest/shared` (domain enums/models, analytics registry) with initial unit coverage.

### Changed
- Rebuilt `SearchableSelect` with Radix Popover + `cmdk`, delivering accessible filtering, looping keyboard navigation, and updated stories/tests.
- Refined `CommandPalette` to stabilize layout via `cmdk` best practices (stable grouping, min-height list, consistent keyboard handling).
- Migrated primitive `Select` to Radix Select with keyboard navigation, menu virtualization, and form-friendly hidden input support.
- Added semantic toast variants (success, warning, error, info) with styled actions/close affordances and updated stories/tests.
- Updated `Tooltip` to export `TooltipProvider` and removed the per-instance provider overhead; demos/tests now wrap multiple tooltips with a shared provider.
