## [2.2.7] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Admin dashboard now surfaces live AI explanation KPIs, latest generations, and a subject leaderboard powered by the `/api/explanations` endpoint.
 - Practice navigation demo page (`/demo/practice/navigation`) for quickly exercising the shared layout without hitting the API.

### Changed
- Extracted a shared explanation fetch helper (`apps/admin/src/lib/explanations.ts`) so the dashboard and activity log reuse payload validation, base URL detection, and timestamp normalisation.
- Added `/api/explanations/metrics` plus repository aggregates to deliver lifetime totals/averages for the admin dashboard KPIs.
- Extended `tests/playwright/specs/practice.spec.ts` to cover bookmarking, flagging, and timer countdown across reloads so the session API wiring stays regression-proof.
- Tightened the practice session fallback/mappers by removing redundant type assertions and guarding active-question selection to keep the pipeline lint-clean while backend wiring stabilises.
- Reworked the practice question card layout with header icon actions (bookmark/flag + AI explanation), relocated navigation under the submit CTA, and added a question-level explanation reveal sourced from stored markdown.

### Tests
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/admin`
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/web`
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/db`
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`

## [2.2.6] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- `PracticeSessionContainer` client coordinator that keeps session state in sync with `/api/practice/sessions`, powering next/previous navigation, shared flag/bookmark toggles, and local fallbacks when the API is offline.
- Session bookmark toggling exposed via the practice API (`toggle-bookmark`) and persisted through Drizzle metadata so navigation buttons and question cards stay consistent across reloads.

### Changed
- Extended `PracticeSessionData` and mapping utilities to expose the full question list, flagged/bookmarked question IDs, and session metadata so clients can react to repository updates without additional queries.
- Refactored the practice page, navigation panel, and `PracticeClient` to use the new container callbacksâ€”removing duplicate fetch logic and ensuring optimistic updates stay consistent across questions.
- Updated the practice fallback builder to emit container-compatible questions so sample sessions behave like persisted ones, including bookmark state.
- Added a lightweight timer heartbeat that syncs remaining seconds back to the session API every 30 seconds to keep multi-device views aligned.
- Stabilised Playwright demos by intercepting `/api/ai/explanations` and practice session routes with deterministic fixtures so the suite no longer relies on live persistence.

### Tests
- `pnpm exec eslint apps/web/src/app/practice/[examSlug] --max-warnings=0`

## [2.2.5] - 2025-10-03

### Added
- Admin API route `/api/explanations` and the accompanying log page in `apps/admin` so operators can review recently generated AI explanations backed by Drizzle.
- Practice session infrastructure surfaced through `@brainliest/db` repositories plus Next.js routes (`/api/practice/sessions`, `/api/practice/sessions/[sessionId]`) to deliver timers, flags, and progress mutations.

### Changed
- Replaced the AI explanation stub pipeline with the Drizzle repository, propagating language/version metadata through the shared adapters, web bootstrap, and server helper.
- Extended the explanation repository contract with a `listRecent` helper for reporting, refreshed exports, and updated unit tests to cover the new shape.
- Added pagination metadata to `/api/explanations`, updating the admin activity view to consume the endpoint and paginate results from the shared repository.
- Backfilled Vitest coverage for `/api/explanations`, exercising paginated responses plus query parameter edge cases.
- Refactored the practice experience to consume the new session endpoints, wiring client actions to persist answer selection and flag toggles while retaining the sample fallback for offline development.

### Tests
- `pnpm lint --filter @brainliest/db`
- `pnpm --filter @brainliest/db typecheck`
- `pnpm test --filter @brainliest/db`

## [2.2.4] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Introduced `@brainliest/db` workspace package with Drizzle ORM schema covering taxonomy, assessment, user, and admin tables with enums and relations.
- Added Drizzle CLI configuration, migration scaffolding, and Vitest coverage to validate enum/default mappings.
- Exported repository interfaces and pagination helpers so services can adopt the new database layer immediately.
- Hooked the AI explanation API into demo flows by sourcing questions from the Drizzle repository and wiring the Searchable Select/Command Palette demos to `/api/ai/explanations`.
- Added practice server action scaffolding that reuses the shared AI service configuration for upcoming session flows.
- Extended Playwright composite specs to assert the explanation summaries produced by the new demos.
- Created a reusable practice UI kit (`PracticeLayout`, `PracticeExamCard`, `PracticeQuestionCard`, `PracticeOptionList`, `PracticeFillBlank`, `PracticeExplanationCard`, `PracticeNavigation`, `PracticePageHeader`) and adopted it in the new `/practice/[examSlug]` scaffold.
- Practice page now resolves exam/question data through Drizzle repositories with graceful fallbacks so the session shell runs ahead of full backend integration.
- Practice navigation exposes flag/bookmark controls with client-side stubs so future backend mutations can reuse the same UI surface.

## [2.2.3] - 2025-10-02

### Added
- Shared AI explanation orchestration (`packages/shared/src/services/ai-explanation.ts`) with configurable rate limiting, question lookup, and analytics tracking hooks.
- Zod schemas for AI explanation requests/responses published via `@brainliest/shared` for consistent validation across apps.
- Next.js API route `/api/ai/explanations` in the web app, backed by the shared service with fixture-driven question lookup for local development.
- Admin API route `/api/cache/invalidate` bridging to shared cache invalidation helpers for exams and categories.

### Changed

### Changed
- Rebuilt `SearchableSelect` with Radix Popover + `cmdk`, delivering accessible filtering, looping keyboard navigation, and updated stories/tests.
- Refined `CommandPalette` to stabilize layout via `cmdk` best practices (stable grouping, min-height list, consistent keyboard handling).
- Migrated primitive `Select` to Radix Select with keyboard navigation, menu virtualization, and form-friendly hidden input support.
- Added semantic toast variants (success, warning, error, info) with styled actions/close affordances and updated stories/tests.
