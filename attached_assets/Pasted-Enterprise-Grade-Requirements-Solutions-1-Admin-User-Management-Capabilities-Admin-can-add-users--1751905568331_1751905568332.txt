Enterprise-Grade Requirements & Solutions
1. Admin User Management Capabilities
Admin can add users with email and password.

Admin can set/reset passwords (but must never view them in plaintext; see below).

Admin can create new users as “admin,” “moderator,” or “user,” assigning specific privileges.

Admin can edit users’ privileges (promote/demote).

Admin cannot view user passwords (this is a strict security requirement).

Moderator accounts must only log in through the normal user login (not admin panel).

2. Database Schema Updates
Add or confirm these fields in your users table:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TYPE user_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'moderator', 'user');
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role user_role NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS password_hash TEXT;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE;
Store hashed passwords only (never plaintext).

3. API Design: Admin User Management Endpoints
a. Admin Creates User (or Moderator/Admin):

http
Copy
Edit
POST /api/admin/users
Body: {
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "moderator", // or "admin" or "user"
  "password": "initialStrongPass!"
}
Validates: Only admin can call this endpoint.

Hashes password before storing.

Sends: Welcome email or notification to user.

b. Admin Edits User:

http
Copy
Edit
PUT /api/admin/users/:userId
Body: {
  "email": "...",           // optional
  "role": "moderator",      // optional, must be in allowed set
  "password": "newStrongPass!" // optional
}
Only allows password reset, not viewing.

Can change roles and basic info.

c. Admin CANNOT view passwords:

Never store or expose user passwords in plaintext (even to admin).

Instead, allow password reset: Admin can trigger or set a new password, user must receive it via secure method (email, or on screen if policy allows).

4. Password Handling Security
Always store passwords using strong hash (bcrypt, argon2, scrypt).

Never log, display, or expose passwords in API or UI.

When admin sets a new password, it is hashed on backend before storage.

(Optionally) Force password reset at next login if password was admin-set.

5. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Logic
Admin: Can manage all users, set/reset passwords, assign/revoke roles.

Moderator: Can only log in via standard user login; cannot access admin panel.

User: Regular privileges.

Example Middleware:

js
Copy
Edit
function requireRole(required) {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.user || req.user.role !== required) {
      return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Insufficient privileges' });
    }
    next();
  }
}
Admin Panel Auth:

Only allow role: 'admin' to access /admin routes/pages.

Moderator Panel Auth:

Moderators cannot access /admin—they log in through standard login, with restricted capabilities.

6. Implementation Best Practices
On password reset by admin, generate a secure random password or let admin specify one; display only once.

Always notify user by email when their password or role is changed.

Log all user create/edit actions in an audit trail.

Provide clear error messages for unauthorized actions.

7. UI/UX Guidance
Admin user management panel:

Add user: Email, role, password fields.

Edit user: Change role, reset password (enter new password, or generate).

Cannot view password: Show “Reset Password” button instead.

Moderator login:

Standard login page only. If a moderator tries to access /admin, return 403 Forbidden.

8. Example: Secure Admin Create User Logic (Node.js/Express)
js
Copy
Edit
// POST /api/admin/users
router.post('/users', requireAdminAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const { email, role, password } = req.body;
  if (!email || !role || !password) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Missing fields' });
  if (!['admin', 'moderator', 'user'].includes(role)) return res.status(400).json({ error: 'Invalid role' });
  const hash = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
  // Create user in DB
  await db.insert(users).values({ email, role, password_hash: hash });
  // Optionally send welcome or password setup email
  res.json({ success: true });
});
9. QA/Testing Checklist
 Admin can create user/admin/moderator, set email, set password, assign role.

 Admin cannot view any user’s password.

 Admin can reset user password (password is never shown after creation).

 Moderator can only log in via normal login, never admin panel.

 Admin panel access forbidden for non-admins and moderators.

 Role changes and password resets are logged and email-notified.
