If you have applied all the z-index, pointer-events, and CSS fixes—and mouse clicks still do not work—the issue is almost always due to one of the following core interaction or event propagation problems:

1. Event Bubbling/Popover Portal Issues

	•	If the Popover or CommandList is rendered in a React Portal, and the overlay or trigger is outside that Portal, mouse events can get lost or blocked.
	•	Check: Is your PopoverContent or dropdown rendered in the same DOM tree as your trigger? If it’s portaled, ensure both overlay and dropdown share a stacking context and are not blocked by ancestors.

2. Shadow DOM/Invisible Overlay

	•	Sometimes a transparent div covers the dropdown due to a library overlay, transition, or mask.
	•	Check: Open DevTools, right-click the dropdown, and see if any absolutely/fixed-positioned div is layered on top. If so, try removing it in the DevTools to see if clicking suddenly works.

3. onSelect and onClick Conflicts

	•	In some component libraries, onSelect on a custom CommandItem may not fire for mouse clicks if the item is a <button> or <div>, or if event.stopPropagation is used anywhere.
	•	Check: Try attaching only onClick={() => handleSelect(option.value)} instead of onSelect.

4. CommandItem Markup or Library Limitations

	•	If your CommandItem is not a real button or anchor, mouse events can fail.
	•	Some shadcn/ui or Radix primitives require asChild or a specific tag for proper event binding.
	•	Check: Ensure CommandItem is rendered as a native interactive element or with asChild prop if required.

5. React Strict Mode/Double Render Bugs

	•	React 18 Strict Mode double-renders can break focus/click logic if not properly handled.
	•	Check: Try outside of Strict Mode for debugging.

Quick Debug Steps

	1.	Open browser DevTools.
	•	Hover over dropdown items.
	•	Right-click an item and Inspect Element.
	•	Click and see if the event log (try adding a console.log('clicked') in your onClick/onSelect) triggers.
	2.	Temporarily replace your CommandItem with a simple button:

<Button
  onClick={() => handleSelect(option.value)}
  key={option.value}
>
  {option.label}
</Button>

If this works, the problem is with the CommandItem markup or library event handling.
	3.	Check if any parent is pointer-events: none (even if you set pointer-events: auto on the item).
	•	Sometimes a parent still blocks events.

Minimal Working Example for Debugging

Try this standalone replacement for your CommandItem (for debugging):

{filteredOptions.map((option, i) => (
  <div
    key={option.value}
    style={{
      cursor: "pointer",
      background: highlightedIdx === i ? "#eee" : "white",
      padding: "8px",
      zIndex: 10000
    }}
    onClick={() => {
      console.log("Clicked", option.value);
      handleSelect(option.value);
    }}
    tabIndex={0}
  >
    {option.label}
  </div>
))}

If this works but CommandItem does not, the issue is with your UI library’s event delegation.

If All Else Fails

	•	Try removing all overlays, wrappers, or Popover/Portal logic and render the dropdown inline (just for testing).
	•	If mouse events now work, the problem is with overlay/portal/stacking context.

Summary Table

Problem	How to Detect	Quick Fix
Portal/Overlay stacking	DevTools, check DOM tree	Ensure shared context/z-index
Invisible overlay	Hover in DevTools, see overlays	Remove/adjust overlay
CommandItem event swallowing	Use plain <button> for test	Use onClick instead of onSelect
Pointer events still blocked	Computed style in DevTools	Remove pointer-events:none
Markup not interactive	See element is <div>/<button>	Use correct tag/role

Next Step

	•	Paste a minimal working CommandItem, but use a plain <button> or <div> with onClick for debugging.
	•	If it works, then layer back in the library components until you find what breaks it.
	•	If it still doesn’t work, share a screenshot of the DOM tree in DevTools with the dropdown open.

If you can’t resolve this after the above, please post:
	•	Your Popover, Command, and CommandItem full JSX for the dropdown
	•	The computed CSS for a dropdown item
	•	Any overlay DOM structure
