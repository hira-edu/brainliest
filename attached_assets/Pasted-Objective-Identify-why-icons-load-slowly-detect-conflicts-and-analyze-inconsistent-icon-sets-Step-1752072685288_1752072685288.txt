Objective: Identify why icons load slowly, detect conflicts, and analyze inconsistent icon sets.Steps:Test Icon Loading Performance:Measure rendering time for <SubjectIcon subjectName="Mathematics" /> using browser DevTools (Performance tab).
Profile IndustrialIconRegistry.getIcon and useIcon hook for lookup latency.
Check network requests for SVG files (local or S3) and identify bottlenecks (e.g., large file sizes, slow CDN).
Test with 100+ subjects to simulate high load and measure performance degradation.
Investigate Conflicts:Check IndustrialIconRegistry for duplicate iconIds during registration.
Test concurrent icon registrations using registerIcons with multiple threads/processes.
Verify mutex functionality in RegistryMutex to prevent race conditions.
Inspect useSubjectIconName for incorrect mappings (e.g., case sensitivity, missing iconId).
Analyze Icon Inconsistencies:Query the Icon collection to list all iconIds and their metadata (e.g., category, style).
Compare rendered icons for subjects (e.g., "Mathematics" vs. "AWS Cloud Practitioner") to identify style differences (e.g., filled vs. outlined, different libraries).
Check if user-uploaded icons deviate from the predefined style.
Database and Storage Audit:Verify Subject.iconId and Exam.iconId match registered icons or valid S3 URLs.
Check S3 bucket (brainliest-icons) for accessibility and file integrity.
Test database query performance for Subject.find({ name }) and Icon.find({ iconId }).
Admin Panel Testing:Navigate to /admin/subjects and verify icon selector functionality.
Test icon search (useIconSearch) for responsiveness and accuracy.
Attempt to assign mismatched icons (e.g., non-existent iconId) and verify error handling.
Tools:Browser DevTools: Profile performance and network requests.
Jest: Unit tests for components, hooks, and registry.
React Testing Library: Test component rendering.
Cypress: End-to-end tests for admin panel workflows.
Postman: Test API endpoints.
Sentry: Capture runtime errors and performance metrics.
Lighthouse: Audit page load performance.

Test Cases:Performance:Render 100 <SubjectIcon /> components and measure time to interactive.
Fetch 50 icons from S3 and verify latency < 100ms per icon.
Conflicts:Register two icons with the same iconId and verify mutex prevents overwrite.
Test concurrent registerIcons calls with 100 icons each.
Consistency:Render icons for "Mathematics", "AWS Cloud Practitioner", and "PMP Certification" and verify same style (e.g., outlined, 24x24px).
Upload a custom SVG with different style and verify rejection or normalization.
Database:Query Subject for non-existent iconId and verify fallback to academic.
Update 10 subjects with new iconIds and verify database consistency.
Expected Output:A QA report detailing:Causes of slow loading (e.g., large SVGs, registry bottlenecks).
Conflicts (e.g., duplicate iconIds, race conditions).
Inconsistencies (e.g., mixed icon styles, missing iconIds).
Database/storage issues (e.g., slow queries, inaccessible S3 files).
