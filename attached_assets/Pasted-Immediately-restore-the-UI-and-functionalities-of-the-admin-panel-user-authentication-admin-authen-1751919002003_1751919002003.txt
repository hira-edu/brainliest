Immediately restore the UI and functionalities of the admin panel, user authentication, admin authentication, and homepage to their exact state from 2 hours ago—before recent unintended changes—while keeping only the newly implemented slug and navigation logic.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Restore UI/Functionality to Previous State

Revert all recent commits, code changes, and configuration modifications related to:

Admin panel UI and logic

User authentication logic and UI

Admin authentication logic and UI

Homepage UI, components, layout, and behavior

Use your version control system (e.g., Git) to checkout or cherry-pick the codebase as it existed 2 hours ago for the affected files/directories.

Preserve and Reintegrate Slug & Navigation Improvements

After restoring previous UI/functionality, re-apply ONLY the changes related to the new slug-based system and navigation/routing fixes.

Ensure the codebase uses the restored UI and features but now routes, fetches, and displays all resources using the new slug system (no reintroduction of ID-based routes or legacy code).

Testing & Verification

Thoroughly test:

Admin panel: All UI, CRUD, navigation, and management features function and appear as they did previously.

User and admin authentication: Flows, error handling, and protected route access work and look as before.

Homepage: Layout, content, interactions, and widgets are as expected.

Slug-based navigation: All routing and links work by slug as designed.

Confirm that no other UI or business logic has changed except for the intended slug/navigation improvements.

Lock Down Non-Slug Changes

Instruct all contributors (including AIs) that no UI, design, or unrelated functionality should be altered until all outstanding slug and navigation issues are 100% resolved and signed off.

Document the State

Document which files/commits were reverted and which were re-applied.

Keep a record of the working, reverted UI as a reference snapshot.

Final Verification

Have QA or a trusted reviewer perform a final pass on all core pages to ensure both the previous UI and the new slug/navigation system work together, without regressions.
