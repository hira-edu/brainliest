There are still multiple errors in the exam system:

Some exams use legacy numeric slugs (e.g., /exam/2) instead of SEO-friendly slugs.

Cards/lists display incorrect question counts—more than actually exist in the exam.

Inconsistent or buggy behavior remains in how URLs, exam data, and content are managed.

Your task is to perform a full, rigorous, end-to-end audit and refactor so the following is 100% correct:

SEO slugs are generated and enforced everywhere.

All counts and data shown to users exactly match the source/truth.

No more partial, legacy, or out-of-sync implementations.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Audit and Replace Legacy Exam URLs

Identify all exams using old-style numeric slugs (e.g., /exam/2).

Generate and assign proper SEO-friendly slugs for every exam based on the exam’s title, using a robust slugification system (see earlier).

Automatically 301-redirect all legacy numeric URLs to the new canonical slug-based URLs.

Update all links, sitemaps, and navigation to use the new URLs.

2. Slug Uniqueness and Collision Handling

Ensure slug generation logic produces unique slugs (e.g., pmp-exam-help, pmp-exam-help-2 if needed).

Store slug in the database for every exam; use this as the only source of truth for routing.

3. Consistent, Accurate Question Counts

Fix all logic that displays the number of questions on cards, lists, and pages:

The displayed count must be directly calculated from the actual questions stored/linked to the exam in the database.

Never show a higher number than what actually exists.

If an exam is empty, display "0 questions" or hide the badge, per UX standards.

Write robust backend and frontend unit tests to validate count accuracy.

4. End-to-End Data Consistency

Audit backend, API, and frontend to ensure all data related to each exam (title, slug, questions, stats) are in sync and reflect the latest state.

Ensure any changes in title auto-update the slug (with redirect) and all related links.

5. QA and Error Reporting

Run automated tests and manual checks for:

Every exam page loads with the correct slug, title, and question count.

Legacy URLs (numeric slugs) correctly redirect.

No duplicated, missing, or broken links/cards.

No mismatch between displayed count and actual questions.

Implement error logging for any slug collisions, mismatches, or missing content.

6. SEO, UX, and Best Practices

Ensure all exam pages use canonical URLs matching their slug.

Sitemaps are updated with the new URL scheme.

All redirects use 301 status for SEO value preservation.

All links and meta tags update dynamically if an exam title (and thus slug) changes.

7. Do Not Break Core Functionality

The new system must be fully backward-compatible and must not break registration, login, commenting, or other non-exam features.

Deliverable:
A fully consistent, SEO-friendly, and error-free exam URL/slug system.
No numeric slugs remain.
All question counts are accurate everywhere.
Redirects are set up.
No old/legacy links or cards remain.
All code and database changes are well-documented.
