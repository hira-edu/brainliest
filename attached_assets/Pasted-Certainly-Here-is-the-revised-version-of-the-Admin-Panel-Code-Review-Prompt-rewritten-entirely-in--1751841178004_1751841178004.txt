Certainly. Here is the revised version of the Admin Panel Code Review Prompt, rewritten entirely in professional paragraph form without lists or icons, and optimized for maximum clarity and depth. This version is structured as if written by a senior developer or technical team lead, requesting a full audit of an admin panel in a Next.js full-stack application:

You are an expert team of full-stack developers with extensive experience in building and auditing large-scale enterprise-grade applications using Next.js, React, Node.js, and modern database technologies such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB, alongside ORMs like Prisma, Sequelize, or Mongoose. Your task is to conduct a comprehensive, line-by-line code review of the admin panel section of a full-stack Next.js application. The primary goal is to verify that all admin panel functionalities are correctly implemented, securely integrated, and properly mapped to the underlying database schema, without introducing any changes to the application’s core functionality.

Begin by auditing all forms within the admin panel—such as user management, content editing, product creation, and configuration panels. You must ensure that every input field in these forms is accurately mapped to its corresponding database field or collection key. This includes confirming that form state is correctly managed and that on submission, the data is sent to the proper backend API route, using the correct HTTP method, and that the API logic then writes to the intended table or document structure. Pay close attention to edge cases where mismatched naming conventions, outdated field references, or improper data casting could result in data corruption or silent failures. Inputs must have proper validation at both the frontend and backend levels, including type-checking, required field enforcement, length constraints, and sanitization.

Next, validate all data fetching operations used within admin panel dashboards, tables, and detail views. This includes checking that the correct data is being fetched from the correct API endpoints or database queries, that the data is structured properly when received on the frontend, and that the display logic is using the correct fields from the response. Ensure that the admin panel is rendering up-to-date and correctly formatted data, especially in components with pagination, filtering, or sorting logic. It is critical that dynamic routes such as /admin/users/[id] or /admin/products/edit/[slug] are correctly wired to their data-fetching logic, and that any IDs, slugs, or query parameters used to fetch data match the expected values from the database schema.

A core part of this audit involves verifying the correctness and integrity of CSV import and export functionalities. For the CSV import feature, examine the file upload process to confirm that file type and size validations are properly enforced, and that the parsing logic correctly extracts headers and rows without truncation or silent errors. Each CSV field must be clearly mapped to the appropriate field in the target database table, and the data insertion logic must support either bulk insertion or controlled upserts, depending on business rules. Additionally, the import mechanism must correctly handle duplicates, missing fields, and malformed data by rejecting bad rows, logging appropriate errors, and ensuring partial inserts do not break the schema’s integrity. In the event of an error, no data should be inserted, or a rollback strategy should be in place.

Similarly, for the CSV export functionality, confirm that the export logic pulls records from the correct database table, serializes the correct fields in the correct order, and outputs a properly formatted CSV file that matches industry standards. The exported file must not include sensitive or internal-use-only data such as hashed passwords, system tokens, or audit logs, unless explicitly intended. Additionally, the export function must respect any filters, search queries, or pagination settings currently applied in the admin interface, ensuring that only the visible or selected data is exported.

It is also critical to evaluate routing security and role-based access control. All admin panel routes must be protected against unauthorized access using server-side checks, middleware, or session-based access control mechanisms. Non-admin users must not be able to navigate to or call admin endpoints via direct links, route manipulation, or manual API requests. In multi-role systems, each action within the admin panel must be gated by appropriate role checks to prevent privilege escalation.

Throughout this process, pay special attention to how field names in forms and CSV headers map to database fields. A comprehensive field-to-schema mapping audit should be conducted to ensure there are no obsolete fields, legacy naming conventions, or inconsistencies between frontend component state and backend models. In particular, mismatches in field names—such as mapping a form input for email_address to a field named username in the database—can introduce subtle data bugs that are difficult to trace.

Security and error handling must also be carefully evaluated. All inputs and imported files should be sanitized to prevent injection attacks, and error handling logic should ensure that failed operations return descriptive messages to the frontend without exposing stack traces or system internals. Uploaded files should be limited in size and validated to prevent potential denial-of-service or data poisoning attacks. Additionally, confirmation messages, loading states, and retry logic must be implemented in the UI to give administrators clear and predictable feedback.

Finally, test the overall user experience of the admin panel. All forms should have clearly labeled fields, helper text, and consistent styling. Submit buttons must disable appropriately during asynchronous operations, and modal dialogs should function reliably without being bypassable through back navigation or rapid interaction. Admin-exclusive tools like CSV import/export should only appear to authorized users, and edge cases—such as duplicate submissions or form resubmissions on page refresh—must be handled gracefully.

Once the audit is complete, you must provide a detailed report for each form, table, import/export tool, or admin feature reviewed. Each section of the report should include the component or route name, a summary of its intended data flow, whether it maps correctly to the intended table or API, any discrepancies discovered, and your proposed fix or confirmation that it functions correctly. You must also provide a final summary that includes all fixed or flagged inconsistencies, all tables accessed through the admin panel, an overview of data flow correctness, a security status update, and a list of recommendations for further improvements, including automation opportunities, performance enhancements, and future-proofing considerations.

Do not change any existing functionality, but ensure that all logic is robust, secure, and maintainable. Your review should raise the standard of the admin panel to meet enterprise application requirements. Once the codebase is shared, begin your review and return your findings in well-organized sections based on file structure or feature groups.
