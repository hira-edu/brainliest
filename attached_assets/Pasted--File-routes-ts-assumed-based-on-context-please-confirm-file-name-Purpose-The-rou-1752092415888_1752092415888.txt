### File: `routes.ts` (assumed based on context; please confirm file name)

### Purpose:
The `routes.ts` file defines Express routes for a Vite-based project deploying to Vercel with a Neon database. It handles API endpoints for health checks, categories, subcategories, subjects, exams, questions, analytics, user management, authentication, geolocation, SEO, sitemaps, file uploads, and more. It integrates services like `authService`, `trendingService`, `freemiumService`, and `storage` (Drizzle ORM), supporting components like `UnifiedAuthModal.tsx`, `ExamSelection.tsx`, and question cards with ID-based routing (`/question/id/:id`).

### Issues Found:
**Prompt Reminder**: "You cannot create new models as this will mess up core functionalities. You only review the provided code and fix changes carefully, ensuring no alterations to the UI or core functionalities. All navigation logic must use slug-based routing as previously implemented, except for question cards, which currently use ID-based routing. For question cards, maintain ID-based routing (e.g., `/question/id/:id`) and do not convert it to slug-based routing. For all other navigation (e.g., subjects, exams, categories), remove any ID-based navigation logic (e.g., `subject.id`, `exam.id`) to align with the existing slug-based approach."

1. **Runtime Errors**:
   - **ID-Based Routes**: The routes `/api/subjects/:id` and `/api/exams/:id` use ID-based navigation, violating the slug-based routing requirement for subjects and exams. These should be removed or converted to `/api/subjects/slug/:slug` and `/api/exams/slug/:slug`, while `/api/questions/:id` correctly uses ID-based routing for question cards.
   - **Environment Variables**: Uses `process.env.NODE_ENV`, `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `process.env.REPL_SLUG`, which are incorrect for Vite. Use `import.meta.env.VITE_*` (e.g., `VITE_NODE_ENV`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`).
   - **Google OAuth Redirect**: The `redirectUri` in `/api/auth/google/start` and `/api/auth/google/callback` uses `process.env.REPL_SLUG` or a hardcoded fallback, which may fail in Vercel or other environments. Use `VITE_BASE_URL` for flexibility.
   - **Verification Codes**: The `verificationCodes` Map is stored in-memory, which won’t persist in Vercel’s stateless environment, potentially losing codes. Use Redis or the `authSessions` table for persistence.
   - **Error Handling**: Many routes (e.g., `/api/categories`, `/api/questions`) return generic 500 errors without specific messages. Using `ErrorMessage` component or detailed error objects would improve debugging.

2. **Conflicts**:
   - **Dependencies**: Assumes `express`, `zod`, `multer`, `fs`, and services (`storage`, `analyticsService`, `authService`, etc.). Missing dependencies or undefined services (e.g., `storage.getSubjectById`) will cause errors. Please share `package.json` and service files (e.g., `services/auth-service.ts`).
   - **Neon DB**: Routes use `storage` (Drizzle ORM), which relies on `db.ts`. Ensure `@neondatabase/serverless` with `ssl: true` is used, as configured in `db.ts`.
   - **Routing**: The `/api/subjects/:id` and `/api/exams/:id` routes conflict with the slug-based requirement, while `/api/questions/:id` aligns with ID-based routing for question cards. The duplicate `/api/subjects/slug/:slug` and `/api/subjects/by-slug/:slug` routes are redundant.

3. **Duplicate Code**:
   - **Route Handlers**: CRUD routes for `categories`, `subcategories`, `subjects`, `exams`, and `questions` repeat similar patterns (validation, storage calls, error handling). A generic CRUD handler could reduce duplication.
   - **Error Responses**: Most routes return `{ message: "Failed to..." }` for errors. A shared `sendErrorResponse` utility could standardize responses.
   - **Validation Logic**: Email validation (`emailRegex`) is repeated in `/api/contact`, `/api/auth/send-code`, and `/api/auth/register`. A shared `validateEmail` utility could consolidate this.

4. **Logical Issues**:
   - **ID-Based Routing**: The `/api/subjects/:id`, `/api/exams/:id`, `/api/users/:id`, etc., use ID-based routing, violating the slug-based requirement for non-question entities. Convert to slug-based routes (e.g., `/api/subjects/slug/:slug`).
   - **Question Routing**: The `/api/questions/:id` route correctly uses ID-based routing, aligning with the prompt for question cards.
   - **OAuth Redirect**: The `/api/auth/google/callback` HTML responses include inline styles and scripts, which violate Helmet’s `contentSecurityPolicy` (from `server.ts`). Use a static HTML file or nonce-based CSP.
   - **Freemium Session**: The `req.freemiumSession` is assumed in `/api/questions` and `/api/freemium/status`, but `checkFreemiumStatus` middleware may not always set it, risking undefined access.
   - **Settings Endpoints**: The `/api/settings/*` endpoints (e.g., `/api/settings/profile`) return mock data or lack implementation, potentially causing incomplete functionality.
   - **Accessibility**: Error responses (e.g., `{ message: "Failed to..." }`) displayed in the UI need ARIA attributes (e.g., `role="alert"`) in client components.

5. **Deployment Considerations**:
   - **Vercel**:
     - Routes are designed for a persistent Express server, incompatible with Vercel’s serverless model. Split into individual serverless functions (e.g., `api/auth/register.ts`).
     - Set `VITE_NODE_ENV`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `VITE_BASE_URL` in Vercel’s dashboard.
     - Test file uploads (`/api/admin/uploads`) in Vercel, as `multer` disk storage may fail in serverless environments with read-only filesystems.
   - **Neon DB**:
     - Ensure `storage` methods use `@neondatabase/serverless` with `ssl: true` (per `db.ts`).
     - Add indexes on `subjects(slug)`, `exams(slug)`, `questions(id)`, etc., as recommended in `schema.ts`.
   - **Performance**:
     - The `/api/exams` route’s `Promise.all` for question counts could be slow for many exams. Cache counts or use a single query.
     - In-memory `verificationCodes` will reset in Vercel’s stateless environment. Use Redis or `authSessions`.

### Recommendations:
1. **Remove ID-Based Routes**:
   - Delete `/api/subjects/:id`, `/api/exams/:id`, `/api/users/:id`, etc., and use `/api/subjects/slug/:slug`, `/api/exams/slug/:slug`.
   - Keep `/api/questions/:id` for question cards.

2. **Fix Environment Variables**:
   - Use `import.meta.env.VITE_NODE_ENV`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, etc.
   - Set `VITE_BASE_URL` for OAuth `redirectUri`.

3. **Persist Verification Codes**:
   - Store `verificationCodes` in `authSessions` or Redis.

4. **Improve Error Handling**:
   - Use `ErrorMessage` component for client-side error display.
   - Return detailed error objects (e.g., `{ message, code, details }`).

5. **Consolidate Routes**:
   - Create a `createCrudRoutes(entity, schema, storageMethod)` utility for CRUD routes.
   - Extract `sendErrorResponse(status, message, errors)` for error responses.
   - Use shared `validateEmail` from `auth-service`.

6. **OAuth Security**:
   - Move `/api/auth/google/callback` HTML to static files with CSP nonces.
   - Validate `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` before OAuth requests.

7. **Vercel Serverless**:
   - Split routes into individual `api/*.ts` files (e.g., `api/auth/register.ts`).
   - Use Vercel’s filesystem API for `multer` uploads.

8. **Neon DB**:
   - Ensure `storage` uses `@neondatabase/serverless` with `ssl: true`.
   - Add indexes (e.g., `subjects(slug)`, `questions(id)`).

9. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure client UI for error messages uses `role="alert"`.

### Changes Required:
1. **Routing**:
   - Remove `/api/subjects/:id`, `/api/exams/:id`, `/api/users/:id`, etc.
   - Keep `/api/questions/:id`.
   - Merge `/api/subjects/slug/:slug` into `/api/subjects/by-slug/:slug`.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Update to `import.meta.env.VITE_NODE_ENV`, `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, etc.
   - Use `VITE_BASE_URL` for OAuth `redirectUri`.

3. **Verification Codes**:
   - Store in `authSessions` or Redis.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Use `ErrorMessage` for errors in client components.
   - Return `{ message, code, details }` in responses.

5. **Consolidate Logic**:
   - Create `createCrudRoutes` for CRUD routes.
   - Extract `sendErrorResponse`.
   - Use `authService.validateEmail`.

6. **OAuth**:
   - Move callback HTML to static files with CSP nonces.
   - Validate Google OAuth credentials.

7. **Vercel**:
   - Split into `api/*.ts` serverless functions.
   - Use Vercel’s filesystem API for uploads.
   - Set `VITE_*` variables in Vercel.

8. **Neon DB**:
   - Use `@neondatabase/serverless` with `ssl: true`.
   - Add indexes (e.g., `questions(id)`).

9. **Accessibility**:
   - Add `role="alert"` to UI error displays.

### Next Steps:
1. **Confirm File Name**: Is this `routes.ts`?
2. **Share `package.json`**: To verify dependencies (`express`, `zod`, `multer`, etc.).
3. **Share Services**: Provide `services/storage.ts`, `services/auth-service.ts`, etc.
4. **Next File**: Provide the next file (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx`, `services/storage.ts`, or `package.json`).
5. **Tech Stack**: Confirm Vite + React, Next.js, or other framework, and Neon DB setup details.
