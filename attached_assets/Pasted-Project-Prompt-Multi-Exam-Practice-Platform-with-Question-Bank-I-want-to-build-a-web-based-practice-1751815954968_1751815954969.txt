Project Prompt: Multi-Exam Practice Platform with Question Bank
I want to build a web-based practice exam platform for users preparing for certification exams like PMP, AWS, and more.

Key Requirements:
Question Bank Organization

Each major subject (e.g., PMP, AWS) has multiple exams/sets (e.g., "PMP Practice Exam 1", "PMP Mock 2", etc.).

Each exam contains multiple-choice questions (MCQs), each with 4-5 answer options and a single correct answer.

User Flow

User visits the site and selects a subject (e.g., PMP, AWS).

User sees a list of available exams within that subject.

User selects an exam to start practicing.

The exam starts, showing one question at a time:

User reads the question and selects their answer.

On submitting, user receives immediate feedback: "Correct" or "Incorrect" (and optionally, a short explanation or the correct answer).

User moves to the next question; repeats until the exam is complete.

At the end, user can see their score/summary and optionally review correct answers.

Navigation

Users can go back to select other exams or switch to other subjects at any time.

Admin Functionality

Admins can easily upload/edit/delete questions, answers, and explanations per exam and subject (through dashboard or via data import like CSV).

Optional Features (nice to have)

Track user progress/history (if user accounts are needed).

Explanations for each question.

Timer or progress bar.

Randomize question order.

Mobile responsive.

Technical Preferences:
Frontend: Modern JS (React preferred, but open to Vue/Angular).

Backend: Node.js, Python, or PHP (Laravel/WordPress acceptable for quick MVP).

Data: Store questions in database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or flat file for MVP).

Clean, simple UI/UX for exam practice (desktop and mobile friendly).

Summary:
Build a multi-exam practice platform where users can pick a subject (e.g., PMP, AWS), choose an exam, answer one MCQ at a time with instant feedback, and review their results at the end. Admins can manage questions easily.
