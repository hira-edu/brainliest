This component is heading in the right direction—it covers routing, data fetching, session management, timing, and answer flow—but there are a few areas where the logic isn’t yet “industrial-grade” and could lead to edge-case bugs, performance issues, or maintainability headaches. Here’s a breakdown:

⸻

1. Route Parameter Parsing & Type Safety
	•	Issue: You cast idParams.id directly into parseInt and assume only one route matches. If both slug and id routes were ever active (unlikely here, but possible if your patterns overlap), you might mis‐route.
	•	Improvement: Use a Zod schema or a small helper to validate/normalize route params. Fail fast if neither route matches.

const querySchema = z.union([
  z.object({ slug: z.string().min(1) }),
  z.object({ id: z.coerce.number().int().positive() })
]);
const params = slugMatch
  ? { slug: slugParams.slug }
  : { id: idParams.id };
const { slug, id } = querySchema.parse(params);


⸻

2. Query Keys Dependence
	•	Issue: Your useQuery keys mix exam?.subjectSlug and exam?.subjectId. If both exist, you’ll enqueue two queries with keys like ["subject", undefined, 123] vs ["subject", "math", undefined], duplicating fetches.
	•	Improvement: Normalize to one canonical key:

const subjectKey = exam?.subjectSlug
  ? ["subject", exam.subjectSlug]
  : ["subject", exam.subjectId];
useQuery<Subject>({ queryKey: subjectKey, … });


⸻

3. Session Creation & Race Conditions
	•	Issue: You call createSessionMutation.mutate(exam.id) as soon as exam.id loads, but you never disable that effect while the mutation is in flight. Sudden re-renders might fire it twice.
	•	Improvement: Disable the effect once you start creating:

useEffect(() => {
  if (exam?.id && !sessionId && !createSessionMutation.isLoading) {
    createSessionMutation.mutate(exam.id);
  }
}, [exam?.id, sessionId, createSessionMutation.isLoading]);


⸻

4. Timer Logic & Cleanup
	•	Issue: You bind your handleFinishExam inside an effect that resets the interval. This can cause stale closures if questions or timer change.
	•	Improvement: Move the countdown into a single useInterval hook or always reference the latest finish function via a ref.

⸻

5. Answer Submission & UX Feedback
	•	Issue: You immediately show feedback before the PUT request completes. If the network fails, user doesn’t know, and local UI may become inconsistent with server state.
	•	Improvement: Await mutation’s result and handle errors:

updateSessionMutation.mutate(
  { sessionId, updates },
  {
    onError: () => alert("Saving your answer failed, please retry"),
    onSuccess: () => setShowFeedback(true)
  }
);


⸻

6. Performance & Caching
	•	Issue: You do three separate fetch calls for exam, subject, and questions. If these could be batched server-side, your page would load faster.
	•	Improvement: Consider combining them into one /api/exam/:slug?include=questions,subject endpoint to reduce round trips.

⸻

7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
	•	Issue: You throw generic new Error("Failed to fetch…"). In React-Query, this maps to a component-level error boundary only if you wrap it. Otherwise the user sees a blank.
	•	Improvement: Provide a fallback UI with retry:

if (isError) {
  return <ErrorMessage onRetry={() => refetch()} />;
}


⸻

8. Free-Preview Logic
	•	Issue: Your “preview limit” logic lives in a useEffect and useQuestionLimit context, but it can be tricky to reason about when questions re-order or if questions are added mid-session.
	•	Improvement: Include the preview check in your handleAnswer and handleNextQuestion as a guard, but also memoize shouldBlurQuestion to avoid re-calculations.

⸻

9. Code Organization
	•	Issue: This single component does data fetching, timing, routing logic, preview gating, rendering. It’s doing “too much.”
	•	Improvement: Break it into smaller hooks and subcomponents:
	•	useExamLoader(slugOrId)
	•	useExamSession(exam, timer)
	•	useQuestionNavigation(questions, session, previewLimit)

Each hook can be unit-tested in isolation.

⸻

10. TypeScript Strictness
	•	Issue: You use as string, as number, and ! liberally. That can hide undefined or null bugs.
	•	Improvement: Turn on strictNullChecks and avoid non-null assertions; use guards and zod parsing to guarantee types.

⸻

Bottom Line
The core flow is there, but true “industrial-level” React code:
	1.	Uses schema-driven routing and query params.
	2.	Normalizes and batches data fetching.
	3.	Has robust, user-friendly error and loading states.
	4.	Separates concerns into small, testable hooks/components.
	5.	Guards against edge-cases and race-conditions.
	6.	Provides clear feedback on network errors.

Refactoring along these lines will take you from “works” to “rock-solid, maintainable, and scalable.”
