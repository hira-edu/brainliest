This is a solid start‚Äîa fully-featured TypeScript-first icon registry and React wrapper‚Äîbut there are a handful of gaps and edge-cases that keep it from ‚Äúindustrial-grade.‚Äù Below is a deep review of each subsystem and concrete suggestions (and some alternative patterns) to make this rock solid for a large-scale, high-performance application.

‚∏ª

1. Registry Core

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Good
	‚Ä¢	Normalized IDs for case/whitespace insensitivity.
	‚Ä¢	Separate Map storage plus searchIndex & categoryIndex for fast lookups.
	‚Ä¢	Tokenized search terms and incremental intersection search.
	‚Ä¢	Fallbacks in getIconForSubject with exact‚Üífuzzy‚Üícategory.

üëé Gaps & Improvements

Area	Issue	Fix / Suggestion
Concurrency Safety	registerIcon mutates maps without locking ‚Üí race conditions if called concurrently (e.g. SSR hydration + client bootstrap).	Switch to functional updates or wrap in a Mutex. Or initialize registry at build time (static import) so runtime registration is minimal.
Memory Leak	searchIndex keys grow unbounded if metadata contains many unique tags/keywords.	Limit index size: evict least-used terms (LRU) or shard by prefix.
Index Rebuild	No way to rebuild indexes if metadata updates in place.	Add a updateIcon(entry) that removes old indices (removeFromIndex(oldMeta)) then re-indexes new metadata.
Normalization Scope	Only trims & lowercases ID, but searchIndex uses raw terms.	Normalize all tokens (strip accents, collapse punctuation) using Intl or diacritics library.
Search Ranking	Exact>prefix>alpha is good, but doesn‚Äôt score by keyword position or frequency.	Introduce a lightweight score function (e.g. TF-IDF) so ‚Äúcloud‚Äù matches ‚ÄúAWS Cloud‚Äù higher than ‚ÄúCloudinary.‚Äù
Category Index	Stores only one category per icon.	Support multiple categories per icon by letting IconMetadata.category be IconCategory[] and indexing each.

2. Search & Category APIs

üëé Edge-Cases
	‚Ä¢	Empty Query: returns [] for no query, but some apps expect all icons.
	‚Ä¢	Punctuation Tokens: meta name splitting \W+ may drop emojis or Greek letters.
	‚Ä¢	Category Filtering: search + category intersection should apply indexes first, rather than filtering full result array.

üìà Optimizations
	‚Ä¢	Precomputed Token Sets: compute token sets once per entry (cache on entry) instead of re-splitting for each registration.
	‚Ä¢	Prefix Tree (Trie): for prefix searches, a Trie can outperform Set-intersection on large catalogs.
	‚Ä¢	Web Worker: offload index-build and search to a worker for massive icon sets.

3. Component Wrappers (Icon, SubjectIcon, CategoryIcon, StatusIcon)

‚úÖ Strengths
	‚Ä¢	Lazy loading via useIcon + Suspense.
	‚Ä¢	Loading/fallback states.
	‚Ä¢	Consistent forwardRef usage.

üëé Concerns & Fixes

Issue	Impact	Improvement
Hook Order Sensitivity	Conditionally calling useIcon(fallbackName) may break Rules of Hooks if name or fallbackName changes shape.	Always call both hooks unconditionally, e.g. const primary = useIcon(name); const fallback = useIcon(fallbackName); (already done) but guard conditional logic outside.
Error Handling	If both primary and fallback fail, you render FallbackIcon, but you never log or surface the errors.	Log or send to Sentry: if (primaryError) console.error(primaryError); expose an onError prop so consumers can handle missing icons manually.
Bundling & Tree-Shaking	Importing all icons upfront may bloat bundle if user only uses 10/500 icons.	Use dynamic import() in useIcon to pull SVG component code on demand. Combine with Vite‚Äôs code-splitting to generate one chunk per icon or per category.
Suspense Fallback Duplication	You wrap both Primary and Fallback in Suspense‚Äîthis can lead to nested fallbacks and flash of loader.	Unify into a single Suspense at a higher level (e.g. in Provider or app shell) so only one spinner shows while any icon loads.
Memoization	You recreate the categoryIconMap and statusIconMap object literals on every render.	Move these maps outside the component or into a useMemo so they aren‚Äôt re-allocated each render, avoiding unnecessary referential changes in child props.

4. Type Safety & Schema
	‚Ä¢	Tighten Metadata: require metadata.tags and keywords to be non-empty arrays so search will always see at least one token.
	‚Ä¢	SubjectIconMapping: currently in code and IconRegistry. Centralize that mapping in one shared constant to avoid drift.
	‚Ä¢	IconConfig: add a cacheSize enforcement in registry logic‚Äîtrack insertion order (a Map preserves insertion) and evict oldest when size exceeded.

‚∏ª

5. Observability & Performance
	‚Ä¢	Metrics: instrument registry calls (registerIcon, searchIcons, getIcon) with a lightweight counter or timing (e.g. performance.now()) and send to your analytics backend.
	‚Ä¢	Logging: expose registry operations via a verbose/debug mode: new IconRegistry({ debug: true }) that logs hits/misses, overwritten IDs, and index builds.
	‚Ä¢	Profiling: on large icon sets (5000+), benchmark average search time. If > 5 ms, introduce a Trie or WebAssembly tokenizer.

‚∏ª

6. API & Developer Ergonomics
	‚Ä¢	TypeScript Autocomplete: generate a union type of valid icon IDs from your registry metadata at build time, e.g.:

type IconId = typeof iconList[number]['metadata']['id'];
function useIcon<K extends IconId>(id: K): ‚Ä¶ { ‚Ä¶ }

so IDEs can suggest only valid IDs.

	‚Ä¢	React Context & Hooks: wrap your registry in a React Context so you can swap implementations at runtime (e.g. light vs. dark theme registries).
	‚Ä¢	Batch Registration & Code-Gen: write a Node.js script that reads your SVG source directory, extracts <title> and <desc> tags, generates IconRegistryEntry objects, and calls registerIcons([...]) at app startup‚Äîno manual entry drift.

7. Example Industrial-Grade Pattern

// registry.ts
export class IconRegistry {
  constructor(private config: IconConfig = defaultConfig) {}
  // ... same as before, plus:
  private evictionOrder = new Set<string>();
  
  registerIcon(entry: IconRegistryEntry) {
    const key = this.normalizeId(entry.metadata.id);
    if (this.icons.size >= this.config.cacheSize) {
      const oldest = this.evictionOrder.values().next().value;
      this.icons.delete(oldest);
      this.searchIndex.forEach(s => s.delete(oldest));
      this.categoryIndex.forEach(c => c.delete(oldest));
      this.evictionOrder.delete(oldest);
    }
    this.evictionOrder.add(key);
    // build index & set icon...
  }
  // track metrics
  searchIcons(query: string, category?): IconRegistryEntry[] {
    const start = performance.now();
    const results = this._doSearch(query, category);
    metrics.record('iconSearch', performance.now() - start);
    return results;
  }
}

And in your React wrapper:

const Icon: React.FC<{ name: IconId } & IconProps> = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  const { getIcon, loadingIcon, fallbackIcon } = useIcons(); // from context
  const IconComp = getIcon(props.name) ?? fallbackIcon;
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<loadingIcon {...props} ref={ref} />}>
      <IconComp {...props} ref={ref} />
    </Suspense>
  );
});

Bottom Line

Your architecture is on the right track, but to make it ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù you need:
	1.	Concurrency & memory safety (index rebuild, LRU eviction).
	2.	Dynamic code-splitting & lazy loading for small bundles.
	3.	Metrics & logging to monitor realtime performance.
	4.	AST-driven code generation for icon entries and Type-safe IDs.
	5.	Context + config to swap registries, themes, cache sizes.
	6.	Search ranking improvements (TF-IDF or Trie).

Applying these patterns will turn your icon system into a bullet-proof, high-throughput, scalable service you can rely on in any enterprise React application.
